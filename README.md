# Segmentation-of-Fetal-Head-in-Ultrasound-Images-using-Deep-Learning-2
Segmentation of Fetal Head in Ultrasound Images using Deep Learning


Dataset Preparation:
Downloaded the training_set.zip and test_set.zip files from the provided website.
Extracted the training_set and test_set folders, containing ultrasound images and corresponding annotations.
Created a custom dataset by splitting the training_set into a training subset (799 images) and a validation subset (200 images).

Custom Encoder-Decoder Model:
Implemented a custom encoder-decoder model using PyTorch.
Experimented with various combinations, such as different numbers of layers in the encoder and decoder, activation functions, optimizers, and learning rates.
Evaluated the model's performance using the Dice score as the metrics for segmentation quality.

Comparison with Plain UNet Model:
Utilized a plain UNet model for fetal head segmentation.
Calculated the Dice score for both the custom encoder-decoder model and the plain UNet model.
Compared the performance of the two models and commented on which one performed better.

Training and Validation Analysis:
Plotted the training and validation losses with respect to the number of epochs, providing insights into the model's learning progress.
Visualized the train-validation metrics plot to assess the model's performance on the training and validation subsets.

Model Deployment and Evaluation:
Deployed the trained model on the test_set.
Displayed the ultrasound images from the test_set along with the corresponding predicted segmentations generated by the model.

Assessed the performance of the model by evaluating the accuracy of the predicted segmentations.
Key Skills Demonstrated:

Deep learning model development using PyTorch.

Data preprocessing and custom dataset creation.

Evaluation of segmentation models using the Dice score.

Comparison between different model architectures.

Visualization of training and validation metrics.

Model deployment and evaluation on a separate test set.

By completing this project, I showcased my proficiency in deep learning techniques, particularly in single-object segmentation, and demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and result visualization using PyTorch.
